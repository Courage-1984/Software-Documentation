*7TSP (Theme Source Patcher) 2019 Edition*

> Patches the necessary (.mun) files & ignores .res files on Windows 10 1903 19H1 & above builds, hence avoiding boot loops & black screens when installing custom icons/icon packs. (Note that patching .mun files will only work on a clean system. If you have pre patched .exe, .dll and .mui files prior to using 7TSP,  the corresponding .mun file patch does not have any effect).

*RocketDock is our classic app launcher loved by millions of people for almost 20 years.*

> Have you ever glanced over the shoulder of a Mac user and seen the nifty little bar of icons at the bottom of their screen? This is known as a "dock." For those of you that haven't seen this, a dock is simply a bar that can be set to the edge of your screen with a background and a row of shortcut icons. The function of a dock is to bring quick access to these shortcuts in an organized fashion relieving your desktop of clutter. It acts much like the Quick Launch, pointing each icon to the original folder or file. It lets you zoom through your shortcuts like a rocket with its buttery smooth interface. You can drag your favorite apps, files, and folders onto the dock to have quick access to them, then personalize with different skins, icons, and effects to match your desktop.
